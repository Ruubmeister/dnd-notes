# What is this about?
This is the page where I will post notes and content for my D&D player group. Below are the two options that the players have.

# Campaign Option A
__What Players Can Expect:__

This adventure feels like a darker fairy tale come to life - think Alice in Wonderland meets Pan's Labyrinth. You'll explore a realm where logic takes a holiday, emotions run wild, and every NPC might be hiding something behind a mischievous grin. The campaign begins with wonder and spectacle, then ventures into increasingly surreal and whimsical territory where things are never quite what they seem.
The tone is lighter and more theatrical, with plenty of bizarre characters, moral riddles, and situations where your words matter as much as (or more than) your sword. Expect enchanted forests, talking animals, deals with consequences, and the kind of wonder mixed with unease you'd find in classic folklore.

What's Expected from Players:

* Creative problem-solving: Many challenges can be solved without rolling for initiative - think outside the box
* Strong roleplay commitment: Be ready to negotiate, deceive, charm, and outsmart rather than just fight
* Embracing the weird: Your DM will throw strange situations at you; lean into the chaos
* Character backstory engagement: Personal histories and lost childhood memories play into the story


# Campaign Option B
__What Players Can Expect:__
This is an adventure about competition, destiny, and uncovering ancient mysteries. Think of it as an archaeological expedition that gradually reveals you're part of something much larger and darker. The campaign features recurring NPCs whose relationships with your party will evolve in complex ways - creating dynamic storytelling opportunities throughout.
The campaign explores themes of ambition, sacrifice, and the weight of legendary destinies. It's more grounded than fantastical, with serious moral choices and consequences that ripple through the story. Expect underwater exploration, exotic locations, and a mystery involving an imprisoned entity whose influence grows stronger.
What's Expected from Players:

* Tactical combat readiness: Encounters are substantial and require strategic thinking
* Moral complexity: Your choices have real consequences; there's rarely a clear "right" answer
* Parrty cohesion: The story works best when your group has strong bonds
* Engagement with themes of rivalry and redemption: The story asks you to consider ambition's costs
